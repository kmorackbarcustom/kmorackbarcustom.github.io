# Daily Work Brief - 2026-09-02

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-03.** P0a-C1 subsequently passed. Preserve this as the historical 2026-09-02 hold brief; use WORK-BRIEF-2026-09-03.md for current activation state.

**Product:** Booking by WSTERA (BK01)
**Priority / scheduling:** QUEUED HEAVY TRACK - activate only after P0a-C1
**Baseline:** `feature/bk-a-v1-contract-remediation @ 4de0f55`

## Current State
BK-A V1 contract remediation remains open on feature/bk-a-v1-contract-remediation. Booking Stage 4 Option A migration-history reconciliation is complete and must not be repeated. CONT-03 still requires remediation and independent review; CONT-04 DB-backed gates remain environment-blocked. No production deploy or DB apply is verified.

## Objective Today / Next Activation
After P0a-C1 passes, resume BK-A as the heavy track: remediate legacy RPC authorization and paid LINE fail-closed behavior first, then stale-hold reschedule handling, regression tests, fresh CONT-03 review, and DB-backed gates in an approved runtime.

## Activation Gate
Portfolio P0a-C1 is not yet PASS. DB-backed acceptance additionally requires an approved PostgreSQL/Supabase runtime; do not install Docker under the active restriction.

## Scope
- Work only on the objective above.
- Preserve existing architecture/invariants and repository-specific AGENTS/CLAUDE rules.
- Read real source/diff before changing implementation.
- Keep credentials/secrets out of docs and source.

## Required Evidence Before Claiming Done
- Exact branch and commit used for verification.
- Relevant tests/checks rerun on the changed surface.
- git diff --check for the owned diff.
- Independent review where the product gate requires it.
- Updated current-status/daily/SOT documents only after evidence supports the new state.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop at any blocker above; do not invent a workaround that bypasses the gate.
- Do not broaden scope into another phase/product.
- Do not commit/push/deploy unless separately authorized by the owner or the active repo brief.
