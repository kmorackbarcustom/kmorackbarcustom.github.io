# BK01 Feature Requirement Traceability

**Status:** LOCKED TARGET V1 TRACEABILITY — 2026-08-28

Disposition values are written literally as `V1 REQUIRED`, `V1 OPTIONAL`, `POST-V1`, or `RETIRED`. Baseline evidence state is separate from disposition; a `V1 REQUIRED` row may still be a BK-A implementation gap.

BK-A implementation evidence is consolidated at `docs/audit/BK-A-IMPLEMENTATION-EVIDENCE-2026-08-29.md`. Static/unit/build evidence is current (re-verified at CONT-03 HEAD `908108c` on 2026-09-03); database-backed authority evidence remains pending a clean local replay and pgTAP run.

## Traceability rule
No feature may appear in pricing, marketing or launch copy without a row here. A new feature must receive one disposition and requirement/ADR coverage before implementation or claim changes.

## Cross-cutting security traceability
| Feature | Disposition | Role | Requirement | Entitlement | Authority/API | UX / negative states | Analytics | Release evidence | Marketing claim |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tenant isolation | V1 REQUIRED | Merchant/operator | SEC-TEN-001 | all | RLS + guarded RPCs | cross-shop ID substitution denied | security_denied internal | cross-tenant suite | data separated by shop |
| Public data minimization | V1 REQUIRED | Public | SEC-TEN-002 | all | restricted views/public RPCs | internal/billing/PII columns unavailable | — | anon permission tests | privacy-oriented public booking |
| Secret handling | V1 REQUIRED | System/operator | SEC-PRIV-001 | all | runtime secret stores | missing/misplaced secret fails safely; never client-visible | secret_config_failure internal | bundle/log/config review | no public secret claim |
| Booking collision reliability | V1 REQUIRED | System/customer | REL-001 | all | DB exclusion constraint + transactional booking RPC | concurrency loser rejected; no accepted overlap | booking_integrity incident metric | concurrent overlap/race suite | collision-safe only after release evidence |
| External-provider fail-safe reliability | V1 REQUIRED | System/operator | REL-002 | all | Stripe/LINE/auto-slip orchestration | timeout, duplicate, invalid signature, ambiguous result fail safely and observably | provider failure metrics | controlled provider failure/idempotency suite | no provider-reliability guarantee |

These cross-cutting rows supplement user-visible capability rows and must remain exact-ID searchable.
